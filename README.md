# TIC-TAC-TOE
### Objective: 
The game is played by two players, who take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols (usually "X" for one player and "O" for the other). The objective is to be the first to get three of your symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or to fill the entire grid without achieving a winning line.

### Starting the Game: 
The game begins with an empty grid.

### Taking Turns: 
Players take turns to place their symbol in an empty space on the grid. The first player typically places "X", and the second player places "O". Players continue taking turns until one player wins or the grid is full (resulting in a draw).

## Winning Conditions:

### Horizontal: 
If a player gets three of their symbols in a row horizontally, they win.
### Vertical: 
If a player gets three of their symbols in a row vertically, they win.
### Diagonal: 
If a player gets three of their symbols in a row diagonally, they win.
### Draw Condition: 
If all spaces on the grid are filled and no player has achieved a winning line, the game ends in a draw.

### Ending the Game: 
The game ends when one player wins by achieving a winning line or when the game ends in a draw.
